Idle Clicker is several things at the moment.
It was started as a project to learn Angular4 as well as test various deployment strategies to AWS.

There are 3 main components:
1) The API which is a Neo4J based GraphDB layer I wrote for a different project.
2) A Lambda layer to be deployed to AWS
3) Angular 4 Client app which has become its own thing at this  point.

Each component has its own install guide/readme file
